# **Welcome to my project!**
## **Project Overview**
This project is part of a web programming course. It allows users to interact with web pages to view information about the latest in technology.
## **Technologies used**
- **To build the structure of web pages and forms**: HTML
- **To style the interface, providing a responsive and attractive look**: CSS
- **Responsive design and interface components**: Bootstrap
- **To handle events, validate forms, and interact with the server**: JavaScript
- **The main framework for creating SPAs**: Angular
- **To implement routing between pages without reloading**: Angular Router
- **A JavaScript server runtime environment that allows you to create scalable web servers**: Node.js
- **A framework for Node.js that simplified the creation of REST APIs, processing routes, and HTTP requests**: Express.js
- **A relational DBMS that stored user feedback. The server receives data from the client (via POST requests), stores it in a table, and also returns data (GET requests) for display on the client side**: PostgreSQL
## **Routing**
The app-routing.module.ts file specifies paths to components that are responsible for displaying specific pages: for example, the products/iphone16 path corresponds to the Iphone16Component component, which displays a page from the iPhone 16.
All routes are combined into an array of routes and connected via RouterModule.forRoot(routes). Angular itself manages transitions between these pages without reloading - thanks to Angular Router.
## **How ​​to use**
1. **Clone the repository**:

2. **Run the application**:
- Compile and run the Java application (if you are using a framework such as Spring Boot, you can use mvn spring-boot:run).
- Access the web page via a browser (e.g. http://localhost:8080).
3. **Edit the code**:
If you want to add more features or change existing ones, feel free to make changes to the HTML code. After making changes, recompile and redeploy.
